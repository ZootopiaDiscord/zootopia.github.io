            <h1>Rules</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Be respectful to everyone in the community.
                <ol>
                    <li>No racism, sexism, homophobic or xenophobic remarks, joking or not.
                    <li>If you have an opinion, say it respectfully and back it up with reason.
                    <li>Don't be a jerk. Refrain from insults and trash talking about other server members.
                    <li>No shit-talking and gossiping about other server members even in channels that they are not in or viewing. The age old saying applies - treat others how you’d like to be treated.
                </ol>
                <li>Keep chat clean and civil.
                <ol>
                    <li>No unrelated and/or out-of-context memes. If it doesn’t contribute to the current conversation in a channel, don’t post it in that channel.
                    <li>No spamming of meaningless text, emojis or images. 3 or more lines or images is considered spam.
                    <li>Limit excessive roleplay in public channels. For light, unplanned RP, go to #rp-lite. For planned, story driven RPs, please visit our RP server, linked in #role-playing
                    <li>No pornographic or suggestive material or discussion outside of the NSFW channels, and no discussion of illegal subjects such as drugs, piracy, etc. If you have to ask yourself, if what you want to post is NSFW, the answer is yes.
                    <li>Politics are strictly banned. Political discussions never end well and no one leaves happy.
                </ol>
                <li>Keep account usernames and avatars clean
                <ol>
                    <li>No (overtly) offensive pictures for avatars
                    <li>No NSFW avatars. Cropped images are fine as long as the avatar itself is SFW.
                    <li>Legible Usernames - Your username has to be appropriate and legible. Having usernames that purposely offend or meant to evade rules are not allowed. This also include usernames that block text in any kind of form or way. We will ask you to change your username and if you do not comply you will be banned (or changed to the ZPD’s discretion)
                    <li>Legible Messages - Zalgo or other obstruction methods in messages are strictly banned. They can crash some versions of mobile Discord and are overall annoying and pointless.
                </ol>
                <li>The ZPD are here to help
                <ol>
                    <li>ZPD have full discretion to remove content or users deemed unpleasant or unwelcome by community members.
                    <li>ZPD have full discretion to change channel topic.
                    <li>Do NOT ping the Zootopia Police role except for emergencies such as a raid or troll. You can ping individual ZPD members that are online if ZPD presence is needed for other things.
                    <li>The ZPD will provide a rationale for any actions taken but their decisions are final.
                </ol>
