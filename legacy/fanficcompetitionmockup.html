      <h2><a href="http://slipsum.com/lite/">No man, I don't eat pork</a></h2>
      <h3>by SAMUEL L. IPSUM</h3>
Like you, I used to think the world was this great place where everybody lived by the same standards I did, then some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his world, a world where chaos rules not order, a world where righteousness is not rewarded. That's Cesar's world, and if you're not willing to play by his rules, then you're gonna have to pay the price.
