                We are turning 3, and want to celebrate!
                We would like to invite you to join us on //todo date here.
                We will be watching Zootopia and a secret movie some of our older members will definitely appreciate.

                Role-play is moving
            </li>
            <li>
                Back in 2016, we had to calm the role-playing storm by creating a separate server.
                Now that Discord offers channel categories and we have reliable bots,
                we would like to invite all role-players to join our new role-playing section.
                All members of the RP server will automatically get the necessary role.
                Everyone else is welcome to join in on the fun using
                <span class="command">.iam role-player</span> in
                <a class="channel" href="https://discordapp.com/channels/164188105031680000/202857406189797376">gazelle-backstage</a>.

                WANTED: Art!
            </li>
            <li>
                We are looking for more art to add to our art tags.
                (you know, something like <span class="command">!zoop</span>
                or <span class="command">!wildehopps</span>)
                We have not opened the channel since 2016 and it's <b>way</b> overdue!
                Link any art you would like to see added in
                <a class="channel">//todo</a>.

                Restructured rules
            </li>
            <li>
                Don't panic just yet! We have not made the rules any more strict.
                We restructured them to be a bit less of a text wall.
                They should be easier to the eyes and better to take in now.
                The only actual changes we made to the rules themselves were the addition of rule 4b and some
                adjustments to rule 5b.

                We are proud to present our new online presence.
                It looks a lot nicer and now has all the information you need on rules, channels, and roles.
                It lets you filter the channel list by role and visit any of them with a single click.
                You can also quickly get to any moderator by clicking their avatar in the list.
                We would like to think of this as our central information hub and would love to invite you to pay a
                visit.
